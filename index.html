  <p>Hello! My name is Rui-Jie (pronounced "Roo-Jee"), and I'm an S.M. student in the <a href="https://algorithmicalignment.csail.mit.edu">Algorithmic Alignment Group</a> at <a href="https://csail.mit.edu">MIT CSAIL</a>. My current research interests are in the human-centered and legal aspects of computation. This includes the analysis and design of regulation for emerging technologies, as well as a policy-informed, human-centered development of technical systems.</p>
  <p>In 2021, I received a joint B.A. in computer science and mathematics from <a href="https://scrippscollege.edu">Scripps College</a> as an <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/off-campus-students">off-campus student at Harvey Mudd College</a>. I have also developed open-source differential privacy libraries as part of Google's anonymization team and researched facial processing technology case law as part of SonyAI's AI ethics team.</p>
  <p> I'm excited to be an incoming PhD student in computer science at Brown University! </p>
